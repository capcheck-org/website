          <p class="legal-disclaimer">
            <strong>Disclaimers.</strong> YOU USE OUR SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK AND SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING DISCLAIMERS. WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE. CAPCHECK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY US IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR USEFUL, THAT OUR SERVICES WILL BE OPERATIONAL, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR SAFE, OR THAT OUR SERVICES WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT DISRUPTIONS, DELAYS, OR IMPERFECTIONS. FACT-CHECK RESULTS ARE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS THE SOLE BASIS FOR ANY DECISION. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OR INFORMATION (INCLUDING CONTENT) OF OUR USERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. YOU RELEASE US, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AND AGENTS (TOGETHER, "CAPCHECK PARTIES") FROM ANY CLAIM, COMPLAINT, CAUSE OF ACTION, CONTROVERSY, OR DISPUTE (TOGETHER, "CLAIM") AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY SUCH CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTIES.
          </p>
          <p class="legal-disclaimer">
            <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> THE CAPCHECK PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF THE CAPCHECK PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE LAWS OF SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN OUR TERMS, IN SUCH CASES, THE LIABILITY OF THE CAPCHECK PARTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Availability of Our Services.</strong> Our Services may be interrupted, including for maintenance, upgrades, or network or equipment failures. We may discontinue some or all of our Services, including certain features and the support for certain devices and platforms, at any time.
          </p>

          <h3>Resolving Disputes and Ending Terms</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Resolving Disputes.</strong> You agree to resolve any Claim you have with us relating to or arising out of our Terms, us, or our Services exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California or a state court in San Diego County, California. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such disputes. The laws of the State of California govern our Terms, as well as any disputes, whether in court or arbitration, which might arise between CapCheck and you, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ending These Terms.</strong> You may end these Terms with CapCheck at any time by deleting your CapCheck account and discontinuing use of our Services. We may modify, suspend, or terminate your access to or use of our Services anytime for any reason, such as if you violate the letter or spirit of our Terms or create harm, risk, or possible legal exposure for CapCheck. The following provisions will survive termination of your relationship with CapCheck: "License," "Disclaimers," "Limitation of Liability," "Resolving Disputes," "Availability," "Ending these Terms," and "General".
          </p>

          <h3>General</h3>
          <p>
            CapCheck may update the Terms from time to time. When we update our Terms, we will update the "Last Modified" date associated with the updated Terms. Your continued use of our Services confirms your acceptance of our updated Terms and supersedes any prior Terms. You will comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws. Our Terms cover the entire agreement between you and CapCheck regarding our Services. If you do not agree with our Terms, you should stop using our Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we fail to enforce any of our Terms, that does not mean we waive the right to enforce them. If any provision of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from our Terms and shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our Services are not intended for distribution to or use in any country where such distribution or use would violate local law or would subject us to any regulations in another country. We reserve the right to limit our Services in any country. If you have specific questions about these Terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:aaron@capcheck.org">aaron@capcheck.org</a>.

          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            CapCheck provides AI-powered fact-checking and content verification services to users ("Services"). We are committed to protecting your privacy while delivering accurate, helpful fact-checking tools.
          </p>

          <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Account Information.</strong> You register a phone number or email address when you create a CapCheck account. This information is used to provide our Services to you. You may optionally add other information to your account, such as a profile name and profile picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Content Submitted for Analysis.</strong> When you submit content for fact-checking (text, images, audio, or video), this content is processed by our AI systems to provide analysis results. We retain submitted content only as long as necessary to provide the service and improve our systems, unless you request deletion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>User Support.</strong> If you contact CapCheck User Support, any personal data you may share with us is kept only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your case.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Managing Your Information.</strong> You can manage your personal information in CapCheck's application Settings. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time.

            <strong>Anonymized Data for Insights and Reporting.</strong> We may use anonymized, aggregated data derived from user submissions to create and publish trend reports, insights, news content (such as "Trending on CapCheck"), and other informational products. This data is stripped of all personally identifiable information and cannot be traced back to individual users. For example, we might report that "claims about Topic X increased 50% this week" without ever identifying who submitted those claims.
